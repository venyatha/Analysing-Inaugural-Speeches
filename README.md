# Analysing-Inaugural-Speeches

## Description

This program works to apply linguistic analysis techniques to a corpus of all first term US-presidential speeches. In addition to basic characteristics like text length, word length, and number of syllables, this program extracts information like the active vocabulary, keywords, lexical diversity, ratio of We:I, and any occurences of Hepax Legomena in the speeches. 

## Goal 

My goal for this project was to extract data about linguistic features and use this to analyse trends across all US inaugural speeches. I wanted to be able to see how the language and techniques used in these speeches correlated to major events and group seentiments during those times. My written analysis is included in analysis.pdf.
